# Home Assistant Add-on: zititunneller

This addon lets you connect your homeassistant to an existing [ZITI](https://openziti.github.io/) network.
It contains an ziti-tunneller which you can configure through your ZITI controller.

## Installation

Copy the `zititunneller` folder into the `/addons/` folder of your Home Assistant OS installation.

*Note: For the addon to appear initially, the supervisor has to be restarted (use the ha-cli).*

*For updates to appear, use the "Check for updates" button in the Addon-Store*

### SCP commands (for reference)
```bash
scp -r zititunneller homeassistant:/addons/ && scp CHANGELOG.md homeassistant:/addons/zititunneller/
```

## Configuration

You only need to add the JWT your ZITI controller generates when you add a new identity.

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
jwt: ...
```

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the add-on and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `jwt`

The content of the jwt file you can download from the ZAC or your controller returns after creating a new identity.

## Development
**IMPORTANT:** *You need to adjust the version number in `zititunneller/config.yaml` manually!*
